# Massive Multi Tap

Author: Kris Sum / @switchsystems

This is a node.js , socket.io and HTML5 implementation of a remote gaming controller, 
allowing you to play games using a mobile device as a controller.

A *Multi-tap* was a device which let more than 2 controllers plug into games consoles like the SNES and megadrive. 
Why *Massive*? Because this system lets you have an unlimited number of people in control!

Inspired by WifiWars http://wifiwars.co.uk/ and Jackbox Games.

## Technologies

* node.js for the server comms
* socket.io as the communication mechanism
* node/robotjs to send keyboard commands
